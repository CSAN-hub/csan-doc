## Purpose of this service
The CSAN service is an Harbor infrastructure repository that offers services targeted at cooperating partners. It is operated by the CSAN platform, and hosted at the Hubert Curien Pluridisciplinary Institute.

## Cookies
The CSAN repository uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer
system via an Internet browser. The dashboard needs cookies for its functionality. It would for example
not be possible to determine whether a user is logged in or not without the use of cookies.

## Collection of general data and information
The CSAN repository collects a series of general data and information when you or an
automated system call up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server log
files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used by the
accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website (so-called referrers),
(4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site, (6) an Internet protocol address

While you use the CSAN platform and any related service that is instrumented through it, i.e. the
repository Services, several categories of data are stored:
• The data you submit to CSAN through the webapp or the API, e.g. by uploading an image.
• Information about the performed operations on the CSAN platform. They are stored by Harbor
in logfiles and are important to help us to determin the cause of any issue you may encounter or
to detect security incidents.
All of this data will be deleted after appropriate retention periods.

to protect the personal safety of users of the CSAN repository or the public, or (iii) protect against legal
liability, we may share your Personal Data.

## Routine erasure and blocking of personal data
We process and store your personal data only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of
